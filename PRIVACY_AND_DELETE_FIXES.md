# üîí Privacy & Delete Button Fixes

## Summary
Fixed two important issues related to privacy and account deletion functionality.

---

## ‚úÖ Issue 1: Father's/Husband's Mobile Privacy

### Problem:
- When a female user was registered, BOTH her mobile and father's/husband's mobile were being masked
- Father's/husband's mobile should always be visible (not masked)

### Solution:
**File**: `routes/search.js`

#### Before:
```javascript
mobile: maskMobile(u.mobile),
fatherMobile: maskMobile(u.fatherMobile), // ‚ùå Was being masked
```

#### After:
```javascript
mobile: maskMobile(u.mobile), // Mask if female
fatherMobile: u.fatherMobile || '-', // ‚úÖ Always show full number
```

### How It Works Now:

#### For Female Residents:
- **Own Mobile**: `******1234` (masked, shows only last 4 digits)
- **Father's/Husband's Mobile**: `9876543210` (full number shown)

#### For Male Residents:
- **Own Mobile**: `9876543210` (full number shown)
- **Father's/Husband's Mobile**: `9876543210` (full number shown)

### Reason:
Father's/Husband's mobile is a contact number for the family and should be accessible for communication purposes, even if the resident is female.

## ‚úÖ Issue 2: Delete Account Button Location

### Problem:
- Delete button was appearing in multiple places
- Was showing on "Enter Details" page (edit page)
- Should only appear on Profile page

### Solution:
Moved delete account functionality to **Profile page only**

### Changes Made:

#### 1. **Removed from `enter-details.ejs`**
- Deleted entire "Danger Zone" section
- Deleted confirmation modal
- Deleted JavaScript functionality

#### 2. **Kept on `profile.ejs`**
- Delete button with red color (`#e74c3c`)
- Confirmation modal before deletion
- Full JavaScript functionality

### Current Implementation:

**Location**: Profile Page (`/profile`)

```html
<!-- Delete Account Section -->
<div style="margin-top: 30px; padding-top: 20px; border-top: 2px solid #e74c3c; text-align: center;">
  <h3 style="color: #e74c3c;">‚ö†Ô∏è ‡§ñ‡§§‡§∞‡§æ ‡§ï‡•ç‡§∑‡•á‡§§‡•ç‡§∞</h3>
